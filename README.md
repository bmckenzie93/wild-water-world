I am creating a fictional water park website.
In this project I intend to showcase my front end web development abilities. 
I have been studying for about 6 months now and I want to put my skills to the test.

Christmas feast is ready! I started the navbar and set up some of my framework so far.

[3:30pm]
I just finished the first draft of the navbar and showcase. I was stuck for a while on the overlay trying to get the text to NOT be transparent. I just had to keep trying for a while untill I figured it out. 

[10:30pm]
I added images to the github repo for this and now my uber slow internet is having the hardest time pulling the updates... Whatever I am going to try and work on this without the new images for now.

I didnt do a good job at clocking in and out today but I worked for about 4 hours on the home page. moving things around and trying differant layouts and images. I'm liking how it is coming out, now I need to style the buttons and work on the footer before moving on to another html page.

Good morning! So far this morning I finished pretty much everything on the home page except for styling the buttons, which I am going to do now. I am moving along at a good pace with this project so far. I am proud of how much I have learned and am able to exicute on my own!

[9:13am]
Finished with the home page styling!!! WoooHoo it looks great!
Next up on this project I will make the "Get Wet" and "Food/Hotel" pages, then make it all responsive! I want to include a form and a model in this project as well.

[2:30pm]
I got a lot of work done today. I finished the home page and got a huge chunck of the water play page finished as well. I am leaving off on the "Rides" section - I want to style the grid and colors differanyly than the "Slides" section when I return.

I am taking a break today but of corse I snuck in a few minutes to get some code in lol. I styled the water play page a bit just now, adding padding to the some sections and alternating the color scheme of the sections. I still want to switch up the grid for the ride section and get a new picture or two for it.

Good morning. I'm up  early and I have some coffee brewing. Today I want to work on "Wild Water World" again, I think it is coming along nicely so far. I'm kind of at a blockage right now, I want to continue with the site but I dont want all of the pages to look the same, I want to display differant skills on each. I will look up some paintball websites for inspiration for my war zone page.

[11:19am]
Well now.. Im going to make the water war zone page a form to sign your team up for a weekend war tournament - and it turns out i'm going to have to implement javascript to acheive what I want from this page. This is good because i will get to practice and learn more javascript, but it is going to make this take longer than I expected. I will however have a chance to display my ability to use javascript, which will be a big plus for this portfolio piece as well as my learning! I am slightly intimidated and very excited. 

I want the form to have:
- ability to add names of team mates to a list for submission
- date input with week days disabled

The user will fill out the form and add names to a roster list for submission.

I am just tapping in real quick to log that I have been working down the street doing in-home care this last week and posting items to E-Bay to generate some more income. I have been listening to code videos but I have not been able to code myself in the past 5 days. It feels like it has been way longer lol. I dont want my skills to dull! I might have time to style the form real quick this morning.

[10:46]
I diddled around with the form styling just to play around with code today. I dont expect to keep anything that I did in the final form though. I actually think I will restyle this whole page to be honest. I will cap off this hour of code with a video or something but at least I got to touch code today!
