I am creating a fictional water park website.
In this project I intend to showcase my front end web development abilities. 
I have been studying for about 6 months now and I want to put my skills to the test.

Christmas feast is ready! I started the navbar and set up some of my framework so far.

[3:30pm]
I just finished the first draft of the navbar and showcase. I was stuck for a while on the overlay trying to get the text to NOT be transparent. I just had to keep trying for a while untill I figured it out. 

[10:30pm]
I added images to the github repo for this and now my uber slow internet is having the hardest time pulling the updates... Whatever I am going to try and work on this without the new images for now.

I didnt do a good job at clocking in and out today but I worked for about 4 hours on the home page. moving things around and trying differant layouts and images. I'm liking how it is coming out, now I need to style the buttons and work on the footer before moving on to another html page.

Good morning! So far this morning I finished pretty much everything on the home page except for styling the buttons, which I am going to do now. I am moving along at a good pace with this project so far. I am proud of how much I have learned and am able to exicute on my own!

[9:13am]
Finished with the home page styling!!! WoooHoo it looks great!
Next up on this project I will make the "Get Wet" and "Food/Hotel" pages, then make it all responsive! I want to include a form and a model in this project as well.

[2:30pm]
I got a lot of work done today. I finished the home page and got a huge chunck of the water play page finished as well. I am leaving off on the "Rides" section - I want to style the grid and colors differanyly than the "Slides" section when I return.
